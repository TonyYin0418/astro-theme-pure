President Xi Jinping has called for upholding true multilateralism
and defending the multilateral trading system 
to bolster free and open trade and investment.
Xi made the remarks on Saturday while attending 
the two-day 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.
While calling for upholding multilateralism, Xi said 
more should be done to safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system, 
keep global industrial and supply chains secure and stable, foster an open, 
fair and non-discriminatory trade and investment environment 
and strive for the early realization of a comprehensive, 
high-standard Free Trade Area in the Asia-Pacific.


The Qatar World Cup, as the global soccer showpiece, 
held for the first time in the Middle East, 
opened on November 20th.
The 30-minute opening ceremony amazed 
the thousands in attendance and billions watching around the globe. 
Narrated by Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman 
and featuring Jung Kook from Korean supergroup BTS.
The ceremony showcased Qatari culture and heritage 
while highlighting football’s ability 
to unite people from different countries and cultures. 
The ceremony featured eight distinct parts, 
culminating with giant jerseys from all 32 participating nations, 
every mascot in FIFA World Cup history, 
including the Qatar 2022 version La’eeb, 
and a huge inflatable emblem.
Support from China has also come in a more concrete way, 
with most of the tournament's stadiums, 
its official transportation system and its accommodation facilities 
featuring contributions from Chinese builders and providers.
The 80,000-seat Lusail Stadium, 
which is scheduled to host the eye-catching final game, 
was designed and built by China Railway International Group 
with advanced energy-saving technologies and sustainable materials.


New Yorkers in the western part of the state are still being slammed 
with a massive snowstorm that has shut down roads, 
triggered driving bans and canceled flights 
the weekend before the Thanksgiving holiday.
By Friday evening, 5.5 feet of snow had covered streets 
in the town of Orchard Park, New York, near Buffalo in hard-hit Erie County.
Forecasters and officials have been sounding the alarm 
on the life-threatening nature of this snowstorm, 
which has the potential to be historic even for the Buffalo region 
where heavy snow is the norm during winter months. 
And the forceful snowfall is expected to continue 
through the weekend with little periods of relief.


Musician Nie Yunlei reintroduces 
a 3,000 year-old reed-based organ into concert halls across China. 
The sheng dates back at least 3,000 years — 
images of it are captured in paintings from 1100 BC, 
and some from the Han Dynasty still exist. 
However, it is little-known among audiences. 
He often gives performances across China 
and he finds that the sheng is overlooked and people don't know much about it,
" The sheng, one of the oldest species of Chinese instruments, 
is capable of playing chords and can be played by both exhaling and inhaling. 
It somewhat compensates for the absence of brass instruments 
in Chinese orchestration.
He hopes that people can appreciate the instrument and enjoy its versatility. 
So, he performed at the Beijing Concert Hall, 
playing 10 original pieces written for the sheng. 


Because of the severe situation of the pandemic in Beijing, 
students in Beijing E-town academy was asked to 
stay at home and start online learning.  
Studying online, the students pay as much attention 
as they pay at school to learning instead of slacking off 
and just relaxing on their comfortable sofa. 
They obey all the rules at school throughout the time 
and actively ask questions to their teachers. 
It’s definitely true that 
the students will make a breakthrough during the online learning.
