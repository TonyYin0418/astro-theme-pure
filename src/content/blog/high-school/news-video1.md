## 文字稿

To celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Saturday, 
Chinese people will often gather with families, 
eat mooncakes and watch star-studded television galas.
A good option this year is Adventures of Mid-Autumn Festival,
 set to be livestreamed at 6:30 pm on Friday.
"We want to creatively decode the festival, 
which is about Chinese people's romanticism, philosophy and values," 
says the show's chief director Chen Lei.
The show features singing, dancing and language programs, 
presenting traditional rituals and elements.
"Our focus is to tell different stories 
about the festival in the show. 
Most songs and dances are original 
and we also combine quyi (folk art forms) with pop music."
As the festival is also celebrated in many other Asian countries,
Chen tries to present the show from an international perspective 
and to move viewers with humanity, 
promoting traditional Chinese culture to a larger audience.
The show also summarizes the achievements 
of the aerospace industry both in China and abroad.
"We're striving to put ourselves into the shoes of the audience, 
to create excellent visual effects, 
good content and true emotions, 
hoping to have empathy with them," Chen says.


China's Li Jingliang was edged out 
by a close split decision in a catchweight bout 
against Daniel Rodriguez 
at UFC 279 in Las Vegas on last Sunday.
The size difference was apparent, 
but the matchup turned out to be a close one 
as Li managed to fire back 
with swift movement and strikes from different angles.
After the final round, 
Rodriguez won by split decision as two of the three judges
gave 29-28 scorecards in Rodriguez's favor.
However, Li had been preparing for a welterweight matchup 
against Tony Ferguson, 
whereas his replacement, 
Rodriguez anticipated a catchweight contest 
against Kevin Holland. 
Rodriguez overweighted Li by 8.5 pounds (about 3.86kg).
Despite knowing the size difference, 
Li accepted the rearrangement on a day's notice. 
He explained his decision this Monday.


The largest station on the Harbin-Yichun high-speed rail line, 
construction started on Aug 24 in Yichun's Wucui district. 
This railways have large construction scale, 
and because of topography, climate and other reasons, 
workers faced with a lot of difficulties. 
These problems were solved smoothly with the help of experts.
On other technical aspects, 
in order to minimize the influence of the winter recess period 
on the construction schedule, 
the workers have planned to optimize 
the platform canopy of the whole railway station.


Agricultural and fishery administrations in Jiangxi province
have rolled out measures to protect finless porpoises, 
which have faced dramatic changes 
in their living environment as Poyang Lake, 
China's largest freshwater lake, 
has entered the dry season 100 days early.
The species is classified as critically endangered 
by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
With the change of the environment, 
their numbers have decreased amazingly.

the food supplied and maintain the local aquatic population. 
Meanwhile, the province established 
a 6,800-hectare nature reserve in Poyang Lake 
and this project attract more than 2,000 volunteers.


Preparations for the funeral of 
the late Queen Elizabeth II 
have begun after her body was removed from Bal‘moral Castle,

where her body will rest for 24 hours, 
allowing the public to pay their respects, 
before being flown back to London on Tuesday.

and the funeral will then be held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September.


Chinese actor Li Yifeng has been detained by police in Beijing 
for allegedly soliciting prostitutes on multiple occasions.

to soliciting prostitutes on several occasions. 
So far, 10 brands previously endorsed 
by the actor have declared the termination of their partnerships.
